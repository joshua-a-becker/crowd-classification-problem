# Using these materials

## R dependencies

You need **RStudio** for the best experience when using these replication materials. 

These are the following **packages** you need to have installed (here with the code to install them):
```
install.packages("tidyverse")
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

## First steps

First, you must click on the *project.Rproj* file to launch these replication materials as an R project. This will set the working directory to the root of the folder containing the *project.Rproj* file; hence, you won't need to set the working directory.

Then, you can navigate to the different R scripts in the **Files** tab in Rstudio (usually in the lower right corner).
